# Data project practice
# Write a program that reads in the sample_grades file and outputs the mean, median, and standard deviation 
# for the fall & spring semesters. Make sure to write at least two functions in your final solution. 
# The more generalizable you make your code, the more you may be able to reuse it for your own project later.

# 1st task: read in the data file and print it out to confirm it's working
# import to take advantage of built-in python functions for mean, median, standard deviation.
